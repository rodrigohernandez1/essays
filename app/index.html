            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <h3>I am writing essays as a way to learn and to further discover my interests.</h4>
            <p>The basic reason behind this is that when writing essays, you undergo the whole learning process. This is explained by Bloom's taxonomy, which categorizes the different levels of learning and its complexities.</p>

            <h3>The way I'm doing it:</h3>
            <p>Reading articles in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> and other sources, then writing summaries or essays on the subjects that were of most interest to me.</p>
            <p>Reading the encyclopedia arose as an inspiration of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-ZH3psUbfU&t=338s">Elon Musk's </a> advice to young people.</p>
